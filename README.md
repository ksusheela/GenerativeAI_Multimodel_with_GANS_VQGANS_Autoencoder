# GenerativeAI_Multimodel_with_GANS_VQGANS_Autoencoder
* Designed and implemented advanced text-to-image pipelines using Stable Diffusion, GANs, VQGAN,
  and CLIP models for high-resolution, context-aware image synthesis.
  
* Applied Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for domain-specific
  and knowledge-driven image generation.
  
* Optimized model performance through fine-tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and scalable
  architectures for training, inference, and deployment.
  
* Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to develop innovative AI solutions, aligning text and
  image embeddings for precise control over outputs.
  
* Evaluated model quality with FID, IS, and qualitative feedback to ensure production-ready standards.
